   Depression is a horrible condition for someone to have and the environment can play a big role in that, those sore emotions can be exacerbated by something as significant as a sudden and total change in the times those people have to schedule their lives according to. <a href="https://journals.lww.com/epidem/Fulltext/2017/05000/Daylight_Savings_Time_Transitions_and_the.7.aspx">This study</a> in particular cocludes that depressive episodes shoot up by 11% during the DST transition, which is quite drastic.

   Mental health aside though, DST can also have physical health impacts as well! It would reason that if this transition would cause the mental stress to trigger depression, such mental stress may have an impact on the physical functions as well. <a href="https://openheart.bmj.com/content/1/1/e000019">this study</a> in particular demonstrates that DST may be responsible for a notable 24% rise in heart attacks during the transition. <a href="https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/Home/PressRelease/1440">This article</a> from the American Academy of Neurology determined that another impact of DST transition may be an increase in Ischemic stroke rate, a type of stroke caused by a blood clot in the brain. It was determined that the effect is a 25% rise in the occurence of this medical condition for cancer patients during DST transition, and a 20% rise for people over the age of 60.
