   Overall, DST can be quite harmful to productivity. as <a href="https://journyx.com/does-daylight-saving-time-affect-productivity">this article</a> explains, DST can lead to an overall confusion in many aspects. <a href="https://www.gobankingrates.com/saving-money/car/cost-of-traffic-congestion/?utm_campaign=731620&utm_source=yahoo.com&utm_content=1">In this article</a> It is shown that DST causes a tangible cost, there is money being directly lost due to this practice in the form of traffic issues which keep people from being in work and waste fuel, and the lost productivity mentioned above. The internal clock is confused by the new schedule and so sleep is lost and a confusion of schedule can be caused if someone forgets to update their clock. Overall, our modern society is a well oiled, although delicate, machine. Because of this even the smallest changes at the scale of that society can cause major disruptions, and something like changing the clock twice a year every year is indeed that kind of change. It is the information age and because of that everyone's connected, which is a major part of productivity. When everyone's not on the same page, confused about something as fundamental as what time it is, this just tends to make everyone unproductive.
