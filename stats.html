   Some other interesting statistics
</div>
<div class="reasons">
   <ul>
      <li>Car crashes. Multiple studies have shown that when daylight savings time causes a transition sleep schedules can be altered, sleep can be lost, and thus car crashes increase</li>
      <li>Crime. The falling back of the clock has been linked to an increase in crime, which has been linked to the change in sleep patterns. evidence of this is supplied in <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11292-017-9299-x">this study</a>.</li>
      <li>Energy savings. One of the original reasons for enacting DST during World War I was to conserve electricity, however modern society operates under a plethora of different circumstances like greater power efficiency now. <a href="https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/74518/1/MPRA_paper_74518.pdf">One study</a> shows that the power savings from DST may be as small as 0.34%, which doesn't even come close to balancing the cons which have been presented on our site.</li>
      <li>Popular opinion. <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/transport/themes/summertime/news/2018-08-31-consultation-outcome_en">An EU poll</a> determined that a staggering 84% of the EU population (4.6 million responses) wishes for the abolishment of DST. That is an enermous majority, and should not be ignored.</li>
